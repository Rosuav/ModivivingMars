Moddiviving Mars
================

A few little tinkerings with modding "Surviving Mars".

Currently, this provides the following features:

* Commander Profile: "Investigator". An unconventional approach to research
  negatively impacts your ability to collaborate with Earth, but you're more
  open to those explorations that lead to great breakthroughs.

  This is a challenging commander profile, but a rewarding one.

* Commander Profile: "Roboticist". Start with the ability to design and build
  biorobots. Unfortunately for you, people feel slighted...

* Game Rule: "Crop Shed". Unlocks some additional utility crops: hydroponic
  biofuel from algae, and an all-natural fiber that can be used like polymers.

  These lack artwork and are probably not well balanced. Numbers need tweaking.
  Might also currently be broken (in a recent change, I hid it behind a game
  rule selection; maybe the functionality needs to be global but the game rule
  unlocks them??).

* Game Rule: "International Trade". Probably so unbalanced as to count as a
  cheat. Unlocks every sponsor's rovers.

* Game Rule: "Tech Bootstrap". Start the game with one basic tech from each
  category: Hygroscopic Vaporators, Low-G High-Rise, Transport Optimization,
  Extractor Amplification, Earth-Mars Initiative, Dozer Rover, and Low-G Shaft
  Tunnelling. These can all show up in the very first position in their
  respective tech trees (apart from Dozer Rover; it's cleaner to not double up
  with the auto-unlock of Martian Vegetation for the Terraforming Initiative).
