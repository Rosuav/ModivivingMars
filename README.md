Moddiviving Mars
================

A few little tinkerings with modding "Surviving Mars Relaunched". NOTE: This
branch works with the updated ("Relaunched") edition of the game. See the
"original" branch for an older version of this mod, for the original edition.

Currently, this provides the following features:

* Commander Profile: "Investigator". An unconventional approach to research
  negatively impacts your ability to collaborate with Earth, but you're more
  open to those explorations that lead to great breakthroughs.

  This is a challenging commander profile, but a rewarding one.
  Broken as of 20251114 but may be reinstated.

* Commander Profile: "Roboticist". Start with the ability to design and build
  biorobots. Unfortunately for you, people feel slighted...

* Game Rule: "International Trade". Unlocks one rover/building from a competing
  sponsor, with option to unlock more through research.

* Game Rule: "Tech Bootstrap". Start the game with one basic tech from each
  category: Hygroscopic Vaporators, Low-G High-Rise, Transport Optimization,
  Extractor Amplification, Earth-Mars Initiative, Dozer Rover, and Low-G Shaft
  Tunnelling. These can all show up in the very first position in their
  respective tech trees (apart from Dozer Rover; it's cleaner to not double up
  with the auto-unlock of Martian Vegetation for the Terraforming Initiative).

* Game Rule: "Power User". Make your life easier - with more electricity!
